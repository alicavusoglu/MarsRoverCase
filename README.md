# MarsRoverCase

NASA rover movement controller

Developed this solution for a case study.

# DDD Principles 
I use a rover and plateau as domain models. For this case, rover is an aggregate root. But in this case, there was no need for Aggregate Root's abilities as domain events or any other extra abilities. 

A Handler created for drive rover on plateau. This handler positioned as an application layer.

KISS and YAGNI principles were considered while developing

# Test Cases are below

Input: The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the lower-left coordinates are 
assumed to be 0,0.
The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been deployed. Each rover 
has two lines of input. The first line gives the rover's position, and the second line is a series of 
instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau.
The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x 
and y co-ordinates and the rover's orientation.
Each rover will be finished sequentially, which means that the second rover won't start to move 
until the first one has finished moving.

Output: The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading
